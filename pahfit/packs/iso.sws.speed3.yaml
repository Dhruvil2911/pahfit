PAHFIT Instrument Pack, see https://github.com/PAHFIT/pahfit/wiki/File-Formats for more information

# This is the Instrument Pack for ISO/SWS Speed 3.
# For each SWS band, this file first provides the wavelength range covered (in microns).
# The resolving power (lambda / delta_lambda)
# is represented by a polynomial of degree 3, and this file
# lists the coefficients CC of that polynomial, i.e.
# R = CC[0] + CC[1] * lambda + CC[2] * lambda^2 + CC[3] * lambda^3
# where lambda is expressed in microns as well.
