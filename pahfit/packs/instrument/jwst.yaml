# This is the Instrument Pack for JWST spectroscopic observations.
# The resolving power (lambda / delta_lambda, where delta_lamba is the
# FWHM of the resolution element) is represented by a polynomial of
# degree 3, and this file lists the coefficients CC of that
# polynomial, i.e.
#
# R = CC[0] + CC[1] * lambda + CC[2] * lambda^2 + CC[3] * lambda^3 + ...
#
# where lambda is expressed in microns as well. 
#
# Resolution data from:
#
#  NIRSPEC: fits to resolution/dispersion curves [1]
#  MIRI: TBD
